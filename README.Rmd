# shinyChooser

This repository contains the `shinyChooser` shiny app with a single 
[shiny module]()
that allows users to 

1. identify all factor columns in a data.frame and
2. reorder their levels interactively.

It is not a full-fledged application, but is intended as an
example of how to implement a dynamic GUI within a shiny 
module. The module is defined in the `R/mod_revel.R` file, 
and relies on R code in the `R/chooser.R` and javascript
code in the `inst/www/choose_bindings.js` files, respectively.

## Installation

You can install the development version of shinyChooser from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tomsing1/shinyChooser")
```

Once the package and its dependencies have been installed, you
can see an example of the `relevel` module in action by 

1. Cloning this repository, and
2. Sourcing the `dev/run_dev.R` file in your R session.

## Acknowledgements / sources:

- The `chooser.R` and `choose_bindings.js` code is from RStudio's
[example repository](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples/tree/main/036-custom-input-control).
- The structure of this repository, and various helper functions
were created with the 
[golem R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=golem).
